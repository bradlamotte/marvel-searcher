This project is entended to practice and showcase the technologies of the MERN stack.  I decided to integrate with the public Marvel API to provide all data; mainly because it's a free, easy-to-use and fairly stable API.  

## Components

**M**ongoDB: database to hold the user's favorite heroes and comics.

**E**xpress: framework used to organize the backend API code.

**R**eact: framework used to organize the client frontend code.

**N**ode: javascript runtime driving the backend API.
